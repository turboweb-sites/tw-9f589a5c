    "id": "8",
    "question": "How often should I get my car detailed?",
    "answer": "We recommend a full detail every 3–4 months, with maintenance washes in between. If you have a ceramic coating, you'll need less frequent deep cleans. We can set up a recurring schedule with a loyalty discount."
